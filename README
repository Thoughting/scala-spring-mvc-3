A Scala / Spring MVC 3 starter app
Robert Roland (rob.roland@gmail.com)
------------------------------------

This is a very basic Spring MVC 3 starter app, written using Spring 3.0.2.RELEASE
and Scala 2.8.0.RC2.  It uses FreeMarker as a templating engine, and sl4j for logging.

You can use this code with no restrictions in any way you see fit.

The Jetty plugin is wired up, so from the webapp/ folder, you can:

mvn clean package jetty:run

and Jetty will be listening on http://localhost:8080
